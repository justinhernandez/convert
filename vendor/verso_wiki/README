About Verso Wiki

Verso Wiki is a Wiki markup to HTM and a HTML to Wiki markup translator.
We use this Wiki translator as part of anyMeta (http://www.anymeta.net/).
Verso Wiki is the first module we make open source.  As such we value your
feedback.


Why Verso Wiki?

We needed a way to easily enter markup, without people learning HTML.
On the other hand we also needed a fast translation of the markup to HTML.
The performance issue was solved by storing all text in HTML and
introduce a HTML to Wiki translator for editing the text.  In this way we
can serve the HTML directly from the database.  Only a small part of the HTML
is so dynamic that it is generated on runtime (ie. when displaying the page).


Which Wiki markup?

Before we made this Wiki markup parser we used the PEAR Text_Wiki module 
by Paul M. Jones.  We made our Wiki compatible because we had a couple of 
databases with Text_Wiki markup
